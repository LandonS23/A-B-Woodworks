Alpha Omega Woodworks began as a division of Alpha Omega Construction, Inc. Alpha Omega Construction began, in 1977, as a remodeling company, which expanded into a remodeling company with a frame carpentry division, a cabinet making and trim division, and a home building division. P.J. Pinkerton was the President of Alpha Omega Construction, Inc., until 1984, when it was dissolved. The cabinet building and trim division, which was named Alpha Omega Woodworks, began in 1979 and became a Sole Proprietorship, in 1984, owned by P.J. Pinkerton. 

From 1984 to 1992, Alpha Omega Woodworks began to bid commercial architectural woodwork jobs and to build display cases for Great American Cookie Company across the United States. In 1992, the focus shifted solely to architectural millwork where it remains today.
